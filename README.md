# Weather-Application
Context: Developed a Python-based weather application that interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to provide users with real-time weather data based on their location, either by city name or ZIP code. The application aims to enhance user experience by presenting weather forecasts in a readable format.

Technologies Used: Python, Requests library, OpenWeatherMap API, JSON, PEP8 standards

* Implemented two API calls to perform geo lookups based on user input and retrieve corresponding weather data using latitude and longitude.
* Designed user prompts to allow input for both city and ZIP code lookups, ensuring flexibility in user experience.
* Developed validation checks for user inputs to handle errors gracefully and avoid application crashes due to invalid data.
* Processed and displayed weather data in a user-friendly format, allowing users to choose between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin for temperature readings.
* Utilized multiple functions, including a main function, to maintain clean and organized code, adhering to best practices in programming.
* Incorporated exception handling to manage potential issues during API requests, ensuring robust performance of the application.
